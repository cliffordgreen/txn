## Advanced Implementation Details

### Hyperbolic Transaction Modeling
Transactions naturally form hierarchical structures based on categories, merchants, and user behavior. Our model uses hyperbolic geometry (curved non-Euclidean space) which is mathematically optimal for representing hierarchical relationships, enabling exponentially more efficient learning of transaction patterns compared to traditional Euclidean approaches.

### Neural ODEs for Continuous-Time Dynamics
Unlike discrete-time models, our Neural ODE approach models transaction dynamics as a continuous process, allowing the model to understand spending patterns with far greater precision. By solving differential equations that describe transaction behavior, we can accurately predict spending trajectories even with irregularly spaced transaction timestamps.

### Multi-Scale Temporal Context
Our Dynamic Contextual Temporal Layers simultaneously model multiple time scales (hours, days, weeks, months) and adaptively weight them based on their predictive power for each transaction. This multi-scale approach captures both immediate context and long-term spending behavior.

### Mixed Precision Training
For optimal computational efficiency, the model uses mixed precision training with dynamic gradient scaling, allowing us to train larger models with more parameters and achieve superior performance without increasing computational requirements.

### Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Time Bucketing**: Intelligent time-of-day and day-of-week encodings
- **Seasonal Components**: Extraction of yearly seasonal patterns
- **Inter-transaction Time Analysis**: Modeling time intervals between user transactions
- **Hierarchical Feature Extraction**: Capturing multi-level dependencies in transaction behavior
